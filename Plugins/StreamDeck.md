This Elgato StreamDeck plugin allows for the runing of actions in Streamer.bot
<div align="center">
  
Feautures |
:---:|:---
An action button that can be linked to an action within Streamer.bot |
  
</div>

You should be able to double click the `nate1280.streamerbot.streamDeckPlugin` file to have it install in Stream Deck

NOTE: This plugin requires [Streamer.bot](https://streamer.bot) to work, and make sure the WebSocket server in **Streamer.bot** is enabled.

> This is more of a proof of concept then a fully realized plugin, while it does work, it was thrown together very quickly, and I'm sure there are better ways to do what it does, and also to add more features/capabilities
