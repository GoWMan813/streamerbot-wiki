Give it a name and set the IP address and Port number of the Streamlabs Desktop
The Default values of `127.0.0.1` and `59650` will look for the out-of-box configuration for Streamlabs Desktop installed on the same computer as Streamer.bot is running

> Connections can be configured to `Auto Connect on Startup`, and to `Reconnect on Disconnect` with a retry interval you specify in seconds
