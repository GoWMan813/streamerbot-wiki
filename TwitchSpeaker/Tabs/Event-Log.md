Twitch Speaker currently is a program of its own and has its own functions, but the event log will show you what is happening or happened while it has been running. Each event is time & date stamped and displayed here.

From the screen capture above you could read the Event Log tab just like a log file, except it is in the program itself. These are stored in a .txt file in the Twitch Speaker directory under the “Logs” folder so do not worry if you miss something or close the program it is all written to the text file. Just like Streamer.bot does.
