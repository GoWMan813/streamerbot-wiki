## Introduction
Welcome the Streamer.bot, a program that let you interactivly control your stream! At first it might seem a bit overwhelming, but after learning the fundamentals it easier then you might expect! There are four fundamentals Actions, Sub-Actions, Variables and events, on this page we'll guide you trough these.

## Actions
Actions is the place where all the data is stored for what you want to achieve, it's the thing that links everything together. In an action you will have all your [Sub-Actions](#sub-actions) and you link the action to [Events](#events) but to understand how an action works, we need to dive deeper in how the other fundamentals work.

## Sub-Actions
Sub-Actions are important to do all the stuff in the action, from sending messages to Discord to making your lights go red to playing some TTS. All of that you can imagine, you can do and if you can't you will be soon! Submit suggestions [here](https://ideas.streamer.bot).

## Variables
To make your Sub-Actions interactive you need Variables. Variables work with the name of the variable between percentage symbols e.g. `%variable%`. This variables are findable on this wiki. Variables primarily come from Events and Sub-Actions. You have Sub-Actions like [Get Random Number](/Sub-Actions/Get-Random-Number) where you get a random number between two values and it outputs it as a variable, in this case: `%randomNumber%`. But the majority of the variables comes from [Events](#events).

### Global Variables

### Action History

## Events
Events come from intergrations, broadcasters, platforms, etc. e.g. Commands, Subscription, Heart Rate Event, Poll Updated, etc. when these trigger it will produce variables what you can find on the wiki, these variables are useable in Sub-Actions.
