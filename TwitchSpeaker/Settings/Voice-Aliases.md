![overview.png](/twitchspeaker/tabs/settings/voice-aliases/overview.png)

Here you can create all your voice aliases, they're used as the voice for the TTS. This is needed for all things that can trigger TTS. You can add a new voice alias by filling out the `Name` field and clicking `Add`, now there is a new voice alias. For the voice alias to properly work it also needs some voices, you can add them by choosing a voice in the `Voice` dropdown and clicking `Add`. Now your voice alias is added, and can be used.
