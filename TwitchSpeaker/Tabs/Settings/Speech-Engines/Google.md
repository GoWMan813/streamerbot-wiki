Goto Google Cloud Services, you can setup a free account and get a trial which lasts for 12 months if I remember correctly. There are also limits.

1. Goto API & Services (Dashboard)
2. Click Cloud Text-to-Speech API
3. Click Enable API
4. Goto API & Services -> Credentials
5. Create Credentials
6. Pick Service Account
7. Enter a service account name, i.e. tts
8. Click Create
9. Click Continue (no roles)
10. Cllick +Create Key, pick JSON then Create, save this JSON FILE!
11. Click Done
12. Point to this JSON file for Google Auth in the TTS Settings tab, and you can now use the Google engine

> Still these should be all the correct steps.
