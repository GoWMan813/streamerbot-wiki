Speaking History is a function that Twitch Speaker has and can be useful. You will find this in the Tab called `Speaking History`. In this tab you will find all the things that have been said via Twitch Speaker. This tab will only keep the history of the current running session of TwitchSpeaker. So, if you close the TwitchSpeaker you will lose this information within the UI but again for a long term you can find this information in the log file in the `Logs` folder within TwitchSpeaker's directory.

To get to this tab is easy, make sure you have TwitchSpeaker open then in the first row of tabs click `Speaking History`.

In this tab as we know the speaking history is displayed.  How one would read this is as follows starting from the left is the cloud service/engine used to process the TTS message, then the voice used and the locale, the voice modifications like pitch rate and the volume of the voice  then the username and finally their message.

> Example: (Cloud service/engine used = Azure - Microsoft Text To Speech | Locale and Voice used = en-US, ZiraRUS | Pitch, Rate and Volume = Pitch:1, Rate:0, Volume 162% | Username = OmniDreamer_ | Message = Test) so that is how you would break it down in this window.
