# Streamer.bot v0.1.7 (Actual)
* **Corregido:** la subacción Get/Set Action State tenía un título incorrecto en el cuadro de diálogo
* **Corregido:** el estado del búfer de reproducción de OBS estaba usando datos incorrectos, debería funcionar correctamente ahora
* **Corregido:** corrige el error tipográfico en Logic si
* **Corregido:** los comandos de control de voz se eliminarán correctamente ahora si no está activo
* **Corregido:** Establecer fuente de medios debería establecer un archivo local correctamente ahora

* **Corregido:** las fallas de resolución de DNS de 7TV ya no deberían causar un bloqueo de inicio
* **Corregido:** GetClips debería funcionar correctamente ahora al especificar rangos de fechas


> Además de poder especificar intervalos de fechas/recuentos para los clips, ya no se devuelven del más reciente al más antiguo, se devuelven del más antiguo al más reciente, ya que así es como la API de Twitch devuelve los datos. No hay ningún mecanismo en la API para cambiar el orden de clasificación. Las entradas de Wiki se actualizarán para indicar esto.
{.is-info}

* **Actualización:** la acción de enfriamiento del comando ahora se aplica a cualquier tipo de comando, en lugar de solo exacto/inicio

## DonorDrive

You can add either your team, or personal campaign for ExtraLife, StackUp or any other charity that uses DonorDrive, and attach an action to a donation event.

This is not limited to just 1, you can add multiple as well.

More info to be filled in.

## Inline Function

Up until now, the only thing that could be parsed were `%variables%`, I have finally added the first function to this, `$math()$`.

Anywhere there is full parsing, you can now perform math operations, and also use variable within the math function itself.

Here is just a simple example of an action:
* Set Argument `%x%` to `1`, `%x%` is now 1
* Set Argument `%x%` to `$math(%x%+1)$`, incrememnt `%x%` by `1`, `%x%` is now `2`
* Set Argument `%x%` to `$math(%x%^2)$`, set `%x%` to `%x%` to the power of `2`, `%x%` is now `4`
* Set Argument `%x%` to `$math(%x%*16)$`, set `%x%` to `%x%` times `16`, `%x%` is now `64`

A page with the possible usages of the `math` function will be added as well, as it is more then just your basic arithmetic (yes, you can even do derivatives or integrals if you wanted to).

## New Way to Pick Actions

With this update, I've completely removed the mess of dropdowns to select events.  This was slowing down the application with the amount of updates this could generate to keep track of any changes to your actions.

There is now a clickable button that will bring up a dialog with your actions grouped and sorted like they are on the main actions page.  This dialog is very much a WIP, and will evolve over time.

In addition to events, most dialogs where you picked actions (Commands, Channel Reward, Timed Actions, etc) have also received this update.

As an added bonus, most of the lists where you edit these kinds events, now have a new context menu item to be able to change the action without having to go in and edit the command, reward, etc.

## Set Argument

With the addition of the `$math()$` inline function, the **Set Argument** sub-action has been updated to fully support parsing its value, and the Increment option has been removed, as you can now use the math function to do this.

![sub-action-set-argument-002.png](/sub-action-set-argument-002.png)

> A configuration upgrade will happen, converting any Set Argument that is flagged as increment will have its value converted to `$math(Variable+Value)$`, there is the possibility this may not fully work, so it is advised to check any Set Arguments you have that were converted.
{.is-info}

## New Hot Keys and Keyboard Presses

A few new keys were added to be the list of keys usable for Hot Keys and Keyboard Press

* Semi Colon `;:`
* Forward Slash `/?`
* Tilde `~`
* Opening Square Brace `[{`
* Backslash `\|`
* Closing Square Brace `]}`
* Double Quote `"`
* Comma `,<`
* Minus Sign `-_`
* Period `.>`
* Plus Sign `+=`
* Break
* Scroll Lock
* Media Next Track
* Media Previous Track
* Media Stop
* Media Play/Pause
* Media Volume Mute
* Media Volume Down
* Media Volume Up

## Twitch Clip C# Methods

Previously, the C# calls to get Twitch clips, only allowed getting all the clips, leaving it upto you to sort through them afterwards.  If there were many clips for a user, this could take a while to fetch, and as it wsa a paginated call, it was only grabbing 20 at a time leading to further slow down.

The first fix, it now fetches 100 at a time (the maximum allowed per call),  This means, ever paged call takes approximately 800 milliseconds to complete.

The methods for fetching clips have been updated to allow for a count to be specified, and it will only grab that many clips for a user, default sorted newest to oldest.

They have also been updated to specific a date range (start and end date) to look for clips, as well as a day timespan, to specifiy the past 7 days, or the past 30 days, etc.

```csharp
List<ClipData> GetClipsForUser(int userId, int count);
List<ClipData> GetClipsForUser(int userId, DateTime start, DateTime end);
List<ClipData> GetClipsForUser(int userId, DateTime start, DateTime end, int count);
List<ClipData> GetClipsForUser(int userId, TimeSpan duration);
List<ClipData> GetClipsForUser(int userId, TimeSpan duration, int count);
List<ClipData> GetClipsForUser(string userName, int count);
List<ClipData> GetClipsForUser(string username, DateTime start, DateTime end);
List<ClipData> GetClipsForUser(string username, DateTime start, DateTime end, int count);
List<ClipData> GetClipsForUser(string username, TimeSpan duration);
List<ClipData> GetClipsForUser(string username, TimeSpan duration, int count);
List<ClipData> GetClipsForGame(int gameId, int count);
List<ClipData> GetClipsForGame(int gameId, DateTime start, DateTime end);
List<ClipData> GetClipsForGame(int gameId, DateTime start, DateTime end, int count);
List<ClipData> GetClipsForGame(int gameId, TimeSpan duration);
List<ClipData> GetClipsForGame(int gameId, TimeSpan duration, int count);
```

## New Action Wide Variables

If Twitch is connected, actions will have the following five variables available to them

Name | Description
----:|:------------
| `%broadcastUser%` | The Twitch display name of the broadcast account |
| `%broadcastUserName%` | The Twitch user name of the broadcast account |
| `%broadcastUserId%` | The Twitch user ID of the broadcast account |
| `%broadcastIsAffiliate%` | true/false value indicating if the broadcast account is an affiliate |
| `%broadcastIsPartner%` | true/false value indicating if the broadcast account is a partner |

## New Sub-Actions

## Hot Key Support
After much requesting, it's here, Global Hot Key support!  There is also a new sub-action to send keyboard presses! 

The keys you can use for creating a global hotkey are currently limited to keys that make sense, and can always be expanded.

The sub-action for keyboard presses, at the moment, is really meant for pressing global hot keys, and may evolve over time to be able to specify a specific window/application.

![sub-action-keyboard-press.png](/sub-action-keyboard-press.png)

## Perform Command
The **Perform Command** sub-action has had a bit of an overhaul to give you more options in setting up to run a command.

![sub-action-perform-command.01.png](/sub-action-perform-command.01.png)

The new additions allow you to set the working directory, the arguments to use (which supports variable replacement), as well as being able to set environment variables (also supporting variable replacement).

**Note:** *There was a bug in the old version where it could not run commands with arguments properly.*

For example, the following could be used for executing a python script.

| Property | Value |
|      ---:|-------|
| Command | `C:\Python27\pythonw.exe` |
| Working Directory | `C:\StreamStuff` |
| Arguments | `C:\StreamStuff\sub-printer.py` |

Environment Variables could be:

| Key | Value |
| ---:|-------|
| `USER` | `%user%` |
| `TIER` | `%tier%` |
| `MESSAGE` | `%message%` |

## ReadLinesFromFile and ReadRandomLinesFromFile
Read Line From sub-actions have options to now parse variables in the line read, and to auto-type instead of always adding as a string

![sub-action-readlinesfromfile-01.png](/sub-action-readlinesfromfile-01.png)

![sub-action-readrandomlinefromfile-01.png](/sub-action-readrandomlinefromfile-01.png)

## OBS Events
New with this version, you can now assign triggers to events that OBS transmits across the websocket connection.

![obs-events-01.png](/obs-events-01.png)

The data that an event emits, is added onto the arguents the same way it is with results from `OBS Raw`, as well as a `%obsEvent._json%` variable that can be parsed in C# (`JObject.Parse()`) for easier use.

OBS events are per-connection based.

## Confirmation Dialogs
When closing **Streamer.bot** you'll be prompted if you're sure you want to close, with the option of not asking again.

![close-prompt.png](/close-prompt.png)

When you delete an action, or a sub-action, you will be prompted to confirm the deletion, with the option of not asking again.

![delete-confirm.png](/delete-confirm.png)

You can reset these confirmations under the `User Interface` tab in `Settings`

## Twitch Predictions
Seems I missed adding in some variables to the completion event, unlike polls where a winner is determined by a fixed vote, predictions are resolved, and the broadcaster or a moderator pick the specific winner.

In addition, I added a `%prediction._json%` argument, which contains a JSON string of the event that can be parsed in C# (`JObject.Parse()`) for easier use.

| Value | Description |
|   ---:|-------------|
| `%prediction.winningIndex%` | Either a 0 or 1 depending on which outcome was chosen as the winner |
| `%prediction.winningOutcome.id%` | The ID of the winning outcome |
| `%prediction.winningOutcome.title%` | The title of the winning outcome |
| `%prediction.winningOutcome.users%` | How many users voted for this prediction |
| `%prediction.winningOutcome.points%` | The total number of channel points used by users |
| `%prediction.winningOutcome.color%` | The colour of the winning outcome |

### Prediction C# Methods
There are 4 new C# methods that can be used to create a prediction from C# code.

```csharp
string TwitchPredictionCreate(string title, string firstOption, string secondOption, int duration);
void TwitchPredictionCancel(string predictionId);
void TwitchPredictionLock(string predictionId);
void TwitchPredictionResolve(string predictionId, string winningId);
```

## Twitch Polls
Even tho a poll can technically end in a tie, I added the winning choice information into the arguments.

In addition, I added a `%poll._json%` argument, which contains a JSON string of the event that can be parsed in C# (`JObject.Parse()`) for easier use.

| Value | Description |
|   ---:|-------------|
| `%poll.winningIndex%` | The index of the winning choice, from 0 to 4 |
| `%poll.winningChoice.id%` | The ID of the winning choice |
| `%poll.winningChoice.title%` | The title of the winning choice |
| `%poll.winningChoice.votes%` | Number of regular votes |
| `%poll.winningChoice.bitVotes%` | Number of bit based votes |
| `%poll.winningChoice.rewardVotes%` | Number of channel point based votes |
| `%poll.winningChoice.totalVotes%` | Total number of votes for the choice |

### New Action
When using `/endpoll` in your chat to stop an active poll, its sent through as terminated, not completed; a new assignable action to the terminated event has been added.

## Commands
After seeing and hearing the feedback, commands got a bit of an overhaul.

To start with, something simple, when you add a new command, if you happened to right click on an existing command and picked add, the new command will be auto-set to the group of the selected command.  Right clicking add while on a group line itself, will also auto assign the group when adding a command.

You can now have multiple "commands" for a single command, also, Regex based input is supported.

> Regex comparisons can be heavy; even with the precompilations that exist for C#, they can become slow if the expression itself is not optimized.  There are no limits on how many you can create, but just be aware, every message that comes through is checked against all commands to see if any should be run.
{.is-warning}

The introduction of regex, is just simple at the moment, and may get a bit more complex afterwards (for example, regex capture groups being added as arguments)

One other thing to note, the `%rawInput%` variable for commands, specificially the **Start** location, auto strips the command from the start, at the moment, with a regex based command, it will behave like **Anywhere** and not remove the matched section(s), I may alter this slightly and add a 2nd variable that gives you both, one with, and one without, I'm unsure yet.

![commands-multi-01.png](/commands-multi-01.png)

![commands-regex-01.png](/commands-regex-01.png)

### Command C# Methods
Two new C# methods were added to be able to enable/disable a command.  Unlike other methods that only need a title, this requires the ID of the command, this can be retreived by right clicking on a command and selecting `Copy Command Id`

```csharp
void EnableCommand(string id);
void DisableCommand(string id);
```

## Command Cooldown Action
From the suggestion board, letting a user know that a command was on cooldown was requested, and instead of just hard coding this, I've added this as a configurable action instead.

A cooldown action can only trigger from a command that has a location of `Start` or `Exact`, regex based commands, or anywhere location will not trigger this action, even if it is on cooldown.

Also, only a `Message`, `Subscription` and `ReSubscription` can trigger a cooldown action.

There is a new column in the `Commands` list that shows the `Cooldown Action` associated with a command.

Available variables:

| Value | Description |
|   ---:|-------------|
| `%command%` | The command that was used |
| `%cooldownLeft%` | How many seconds are left for the cooldown, and is the maximum of the global and user cooldown left |
| `%globalCooldownLeft%` | How many seconds are left for the global cooldown of the command |
| `%userCooldownLeft%` | How many seconds are left for the user cooldown of the command |

There is also a new websocket event that can be subscribed to, `CooldownEvent` for `Commands`

![sub-action-commandcooldown-01.png](/sub-action-commandcooldown-01.png)

The most basic subaction you could add, would be a `Twitch Message` with the message `%user%, %command% is on cooldown for %cooldownLeft%s`

## Twitch Gift Sub Bomb/Gift Subs
In previous versions, when someone dropped a gift bomb (more then 2 gift subs in a single go), only the gift bomb event itself was triggered, and all associated gift sub events for it were silently discarded.

With this version, the gift subs are no longer discarded, they are now also sent, and there is an argument `%fromGiftBomb%` that will exist. If this is true, the sub is from a gift bomb, if false, its not.

I've also added `%subBombCount%` which will give the number of gift subs, if ths gift sub belongs to a gift bomb.

One last new argument is `%cumulativeMonths%`, this can have how many months the user receiving the gift sub has been subscribed for, if its 1, they are a new subscription, if its > 1, then its a resub.  There are chances where it can be 0 from what I've seen.  So this value could be used to welcome a new gifted subscriber.

## New Sub-Actions

### OBS Take Screenshot
Up until now, you had to use OBS Raw to take a screenshot in OBS, here is a sub-action ot make things a bit simpler.

![sub-action-obs-takescreenshot-01.png](/sub-action-obs-takescreenshot-01.png)

`Scene`, `Source` and `File Path` all support variable replacements, and after a screenshot is successfully taken, the full file path is added back onto the arguments as `%screenshotFile%`.

There is a new date time friendly variable that can be used, `%filedatetime%` which is of the format `yyyyMMdd.hhmmss`.

### OBS Set Audio Track State
With this sub-action you can alter which audio tracks a source can be active on

![sub-action-setaudiotrackstate-01.png](/sub-action-setaudiotrackstate-01.png)

> This sub-action ***requires*** obs-websocket version 4.9.1
{.is-info}

## OBS Set Media State
Control the state of media playback, you'll be able to `Play`, `Pause`, `Restart`, `Stop`, `Next`, `Previous` the specified media.

![sub-action-obs-setmediastate-01.png](/sub-action-obs-setmediastate-01.png)

The following C# methods were also added to control media via code.
```csharp
void ObsSetMediaState(string scene, string source, int state, int connection = 0);
void ObsMediaPlay(string scene, string source, int connection = 0);
void ObsMediaPause(string scene, string source, int connection = 0);
void ObsMediaRestart(string scene, string source, int connection = 0);
void ObsMediaStop(string scene, string source, int connection = 0);
void ObsMediaNext(string scene, string source, int connection = 0);
void ObsMediaPrevious(string scene, string source, int connection = 0);
```

## Twitch Set Channel Title
Using this sub-action, you'll be able to set the title of your channel, either to a fixed value, or using variables.

![sub-action-setchanneltitle-01.png](/sub-action-setchanneltitle-01.png)

The following C# method was also added to set your channel title via code.
```csharp
bool SetChannelTitle(string title);
```

An example action that you can assign to a `!title` command

```

## Twitch Set Game
Using this sub-action, you'll be able to set the game for your channel, again using a fixed game that you can set from a list, or by using variables

![sub-action-setchannelgame-01.png](/sub-action-setchannelgame-01.png)

![sub-action-setchannelgame-02.png](/sub-action-setchannelgame-02.png)

The following C# methods were also added to set a game via code.
```csharp
GameInfo SetChannelGame(string game);
bool SetChannelGameById(string gameId);

public class GameInfo
{
		public int Id { get; set; }
		public string Name { get; set; }
		public string BoxArtUrl { get; set; }
}
```

## Experimental Linux Support

> There is no guarentee this will work 100%, there are areas of the app that may not function correctly, so this will be a complete work in progress depending on time/effort.
{.is-warning}

It is possible to run this current version (**0.1.4**) using wine/wine64 within Linux

The entire network stack was re-written to make this possible, as it was a major blocker.

I've been doing some tests using the staging version of Wine, which is v6.19 in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

For your Wine setup, you'll want the following:
```
winetricks dotnet472
winetricks d3dcompiler_47
winetricks dxvk
```
You will also want to make sure gnutls (for 32-bit, lib32-gnutls).

This information should also apply to TwitchSpeaker, one area that will not work in TwitchSpeaker are SAPI5 voices, and the Azure voices may also not work. Again, this is very experimental.

A dedicated page on the wiki will likely be created for those who are using/testing it under Linux to list what works and what the current issues are.

> Running **Streamer.bot** and/or **TwitchSpeaker** under Linux is considered to be experimental, so expect bugs/issues.
{.is-warning}

## Copy Pasta Sub-Actions
As more of a QoL improvement, I have started implementing some basic copy and paste functionality.  First up to get this capability is the sub-actions.

While it does copy data to your clipboard, meaning it could be shared; it is **not** recommended to, currently, when you paste an action, no real sanitization and checks are done (*yet*), as it is meant to be pasted back into your own running instance of **Streamer.bot** which has all the supported components setup already (i.e., OBS connection, Queues, etc).

Also, at the moment, you can only copy 1 sub-action, this may change in the future when I start enabling multi-select capabilities, but, it's 1 step at a time.

## New Sub-Actions

### Subscriber Only
This will let you enable or disable Subscriber Only mode for your channel

### Emote Only
This will let you enable or disable Emote Only mode for your channel

### Read Lines From File
With this sub-action, you'll be able to read all the lines of a file into variables.  It will put each line of the file into `%line#%` where # is the line number starting from 0. `%lineCount%` will also be added with the total number of lines.

### Fetch Url
You can now fetch simple api endpoints and put them into a variable of your choosing. The Url supports variable parsing.

![sub-action-fetch-url-01.png](/sub-action-fetch-url-01.png)

### Pick Color
Added a way to pick a colour and put it on the arguments for an action.

![sub-action-pick-color-01.png](/sub-action-pick-color-01.png)

When this sub-action is run, the follow variables are added to the arguments

| Variables | Description |
|       ---:|-------------|
| `%var.color.a%` | The alpha value |
| `%var.color.r%` | The red value |
| `%var.color.g%` | The gren value |
| `%var.color.b%` | The blue value |
| `%var.html%` | The html color code |
| `%var.htmlalpha%` | The html color code with alpha value |
| `%var.obs%` | The color as an OBS ABGR value |

> This may evolve a bit in the future, either by way of more capabilities, or moving it to a different area
{.is-info}

### Comment
Just an action that you can put text into, that'll show up as a comment, pre and post fixed with **, it will not be executed when the action is run.

## New C# Methods
2 new methods are available for enabling/disabling Subscriber/Emote only modes
```csharp
void TwitchSubscriberOnly(bool enabled = true);
void TwitchEmoteOnly(bool enabled = true);
```

## Groups
The groups section has had a few updates.  The list of groups has been udpated with some context menu options.  You can toggle the Bot status of a group, delete, clear a group; as well as export a group to a file, and import from a file.

There is more work to be done here. These are the first steps.

## Find Refs
Using the Jokes code that is in the examples channel of the discord, I went through and tried to get **Streamer.bot** to be a bit more lenient on how it adds/removes references when you click the Find Refs button on the Execute C# Code dialog.  It is still not perfect, nor will it ever be, as trying to "figure" out what references are required is not an easy thing to do without it taking a while.

Join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/zuXpPpgD5K) if you have any questions, would like to share what you've created, or or would like to lend a hand!

### OBS Raw
I have gone through and updated how OBS Raw behaves, previously it would only return if the status of the call was a success or not.  Now, it will take all the JSON values returned and add them onto the argument list in the form of `obsRaw.{path}`, so `status` is now in `obsRaw.status`, so you can check this if the call was successful or not.  The values that are put on the arguments are dynamic and depend on what you are sending.

A note, array will be added as `obsRaw.data.value[0].id` for example.

If you are using OBS Raw through C#, you will be given back the JSON as a string, so you can use a JObject.Parse() to convert it to something usable in your code.

#### Variable Replacement

You can also use variables in OBS Raw.  To use variables, just add the variable inbetween quotes for your json property

Example:
```json
{
  "test": "%variable%"
}
```

The underlying code will go through all the properties and do any variable replacements it finds.

### Twitch Hosts
Seems as tho this event was "broken", so, went through, fixed it up, and re-enabled it.  One note, viewer count according to Twitch's own references should be available, but what it says should happen doesn't.

The event does provide a `%viewers%` variable, which is best guess accurate, utilizing an API call to retrieve information.

When starting Streamer.bot without a logs or data folder, it will auto-create these folders, and move any existing logs and settings into this folder for you, and carry on like normal.

### EXE Changes
You'll notice that the archive is a bit large, and contains more files now.  I've decided to split all System/Microsoft libraries out of the merge and will now be alongside the application.  I'm hoping that this might reduce the number of false positives in anti-malware applications.

### Execute C# Code
Finding refs for Execute C# has been improved, and seems to do a better job at finding system related references, this is still an ongoing tweaking.

This also occurs during an import when a C# sub-action is found, it will re-find references for your local system and update them, there still may need to be manual finding of refs, and the import/export process will likely improve for these scenarios (i.e. including external libraries, and more)









# Streamer.bot v0.0.62
Visit [Streamer.bot 0.0.61](#streamerbot-v0061) to see all the shiny new features and updates.

Just a small fix

* Fix double clicking on commands
* Possible startup error fix
* Fix strange behaviour with new control used for grouping in actions/commands

> **NOTE**
> Windows Defender may give a false positive, I believe this is due to the inclusion of the Roslyn compilers which power the C# compiling capabilities. The fact they're there and there is code within the app to compile stuff itself I believe is what's causing the flagging, I'm not sure how to remedy this.

### New Features

#### Sub-Actions
As an experiment, I am adding new custom menu item to run certain methods contained within a sub-action.  At this moment, this only applies to Execute C# Code, there are 2 new menu items to Compile, and Unload; which will trigger a compile and init of the code, or it will fully unload/dispose of the code (like what happens in a shutdown)

#### Execute C# Code
There is a new option for a delayed start, as well as an option to run a method on a UI thread.  The reason for this addition is, you're able to us WinForms and create fully backed UI code.  But to do this, anything WinForm related **MUST** originate from a UI thread.  This usage is fairly advanced, so if you're in a position to do this, then you'll understand more.

I have added 3 methods to be able to create and end Twitch Polls

```csharp
bool TwitchPollCreate(string title, List<string> choices, int duration, int bitsPerVote = 0, int channelPointsPerVote = 0);
void TwitchPollTerminate(string pollId);
void TwitchPollArchive(string pollId);
```

Added 2 new methods that will allow you to enable/disable actions

```csharp
void DisableAction(string actionName);
void EnableAction(string actionName);
```




# Streamer.bot v0.0.60
* Fix arguments for message/cheer, relating to emotes
* Fix Streamlabs/Streamelements ranges for donation amounts, seems I forgot to wire that up
* Fix handling increment in GlobalSet, wasn't working with new variables correctly
* Misc fixes/tweaks
