Custom commands let your Moderators, Subscribers, VIP's, Regulars and Everyone have a unique command/voice, this can be done be filling out a command in the `Command` field e.g. `!say` and for the `Voice Alias` field just simply choose one from the list and lastly you can limit this command to certain people so some can and others can't use it, here you can just modify everything like you want it.
