## Overview
![overview.png](/twitchspeaker/tabs/settings/replacement/overview.png =700x)

## Configuration
### Bad Word Filter
In the bad word filter you can add all words that you don't want to get included in the TTS. When a word out of the list occurs you can choose to filter it in different ways with the `Filter Action`, you can choose for `Disabled` (ignores all bad words), `Strip` (erases all bad words from TTS) or `Yeet All` (literally yeets all the contents of the TTS).

### Regex Replacement
Here you can use regular expressions to change certain parts of the TTS to something else, you can also just use plain text if you're aren't familar with regular expressions.
**don't abuse this to putting words in other people mouths**.
