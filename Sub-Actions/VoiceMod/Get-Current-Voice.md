# Get Current Voice 

With the Streamer.bot *v0.1.8*{.version-badge} update came the VoiceMod Integration and various actions we can use. The first of the actions being **Get Current Voice** in use via VoiceMod


First make sure Streamer.bot is connected to VoiceMod (if you haven't done this and /or don't know how please check out the how to connect to VoiceMod [here](/en/Integrations/VoiceMod)
Once you have done this you can now proceed to the set up this Sub-Action.

To do this navigate to the `Actions` tab, next you can either create a new action or use an existing one.
Next in the Sub-Action's pane you will need to add this sub action so to do this we `Right Click` in the Sub-Action pane next navigate the menus through the following `Add Sub-Action` the down the second menu to `VoiceMod` the click on the `Get Current Voice` action and that is it Streamer.bot will query VoiceMod to get the current VoiceMod voice you're using and assign in to `%currentVoiceId%`.
