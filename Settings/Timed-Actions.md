![timed-actions-context-018.png](/timed-actions-context-018.png)

<kbd>Right-clicking</kbd> inside the pane opens the context menu

## Context Menu
----:|:------------
`Add` | Add a new `Timed Action`
`Edit` | Open the `Edit Timed Action` dialogue to modify the highlighted entry | This is the same as <kbd>Double-Clicking</kbd> the entry
`Delete` | Delete the highlighted entry
`Set Action` | Shortcut to the `Select Action` dialogue
`Enabled` | Shortcut to set the Active state of the Folder Watch entry

When a timer becomes enabled its action will execute on the next occurence.

Unless manually overridden by another [action](/Actions), the `Timed action` will only execute again if both the `Interval` and `Lines` criteria have been met

## Edit Timed Action

----:|:------------
`Enabled` | States this timer is currently running
`Repeat` | Defines if the `Timed Action` should automatically run again once the limiting criteria are met
`Interval` | Minimum time in seconds that must elapse before the action will run again | If `Random` is checked this becomes an upper and lower bound entry
`Lines` | Any non-zero value will pause the action from running again until that many messages have been recieved in chat
`Action` | Choose the [action](/Actions) to execute when the timer state becomes `Enabled`

### Action Selector
