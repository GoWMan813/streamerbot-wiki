Yes, you read the correctly, as of **Streamer.bot** v0.1.15, there will be MIDI support!

So, it will now be possible to run actions by using your MIDI Piano, and MIDI synth, oh, even your MIDI wind instrument, or anything that supports MIDI!

When adding an `Event`, you will be able to just press the key, turn the knob, or flick the wheel to have it auto populate all the settings for you.

This section is a WIP for information, but to get you started, here are some screenshots.

To get started with MIDI follow these steps:

1. Add a Device, to do this, right click in the top section of the MIDI tab, and click Add
2. Pick your device from the drop down, and give it a name, and click Ok
3. Select the device you just added
4. Right click anywhere in the bottom list, and Add an event.
5. With the Add Event dialog open, you can pr
ess any of the keys on your device to have it fill in all the data for you and show an example of what the arguments will look like.
