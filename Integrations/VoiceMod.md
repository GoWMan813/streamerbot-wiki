## VoiceMod
With Streamer.bot *v0.1.8*{.version-badge} came with [VoiceMod](https://www.voicemod.net/) Integration and various actions we can use this  includes those listed below:
- Get Current Voice
- Set Random Voice
- Select Voice
- Select Voice by Id
- Set Background Effect State
- Set Censor State
- Set Hear My Voice State
- Set Mute State
- Set Voice Changer State

To do this we first need to make sure you are using Streamer.bot (v0.18 or greater) is linked to your VoiceMod.


#### Connecting to VoiceMod
To do this navigate the following tabs top row of tabs click `Integrations` then on the second row of tabs click `VoiceMod`. Once you are in this tab you will see the available options `Auto Connect, Auto Reconnect ` and a button that says `Connect to VoiceMod`.  Make sure you have the VoiceMod Application open and running for it to connect successfully. If VoiceMod isn’t running, then link cannot/won’t be made.

When Streamer.bot is connected to VoiceMod successfully you will see that the `Connect to VoiceMod` button has changed to `Disconnect from VoiceMod`. Now we are ready to use the new integration action that are available to us.

This is it we are now ready to put the VoiceMod Integration to work.
