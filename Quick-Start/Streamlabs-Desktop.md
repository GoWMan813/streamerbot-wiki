# Prerequisites

Obtain your **API Token** and **Port** from your Streamlabs Desktop settings.

Later, you will need to match these settings in Streamer.bot

# Configuration

Streamlabs Desktop configuration can be found by navigating to the following tabs in Streamer.bot:
`Broadcasters` -> `Streamlabs Desktop`

![streamlabs_desktop_landing_page.png](/quick-start/streamlabs_desktop_landing_page.png =700x)

To add a new connection, <kbd>Right-Click</kbd> -> <kbd>Add</kbd> to open the new connection dialogue.

Give it a name and set the IP address and Port number of the Streamlabs Desktop
The Default values of `127.0.0.1` and `59650` will look for the out-of-box configuration for Streamlabs Desktop installed on the same computer as Streamer.bot is running

> Connections can be configured to `Auto Connect on Startup`, and to `Reconnect on Disconnect` with a retry interval you specify in seconds
