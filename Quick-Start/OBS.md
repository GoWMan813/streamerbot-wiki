# Prerequisites
To enable remote control of your **OBS Studio** instance from **Streamer.bot** you will need to first install the OBS Websocket Plugin
> **OBS Websocket v4.x is the only supported version at this time**
> v5.x requires a re-write and is being worked on, but is still missing capabilities
> Download OBS Websocket plugin below [](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/obs-websocket-remote-control-obs-studio-from-websockets.466/)

- [<img src="/logos/obs-websocket.png"/>**OBS WebSocket *Download obs-websocket v4.9.1***](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-websocket/releases/tag/4.9.1)

After installing the plugin and restarting OBS, you should be able to configure your WebSocket Server settings as you wish:

Later, you will need to match these settings in Streamer.bot


# Configuration

Once configured, connected OBS sessions will report their status on the OBS tab in Streamer.bot

To add a new connection, <kbd>Right-Click</kbd> -> <kbd>Add</kbd> to open the new connection dialogue
![New Connection](/119574587-9adb7e80-bdad-11eb-82c1-ec9ed668a40d.png)

Give it a name and set the IP address and Port number of the OBS Websocket
The Default values of `127.0.0.1` and `4444` will look for the out-of-box configuration for OBS installed on the same computer as Streamer.bot is running

`Password` Will not be required unless you have specified one in OBS

> Connections can be configured to `Auto Connect on Startup`, and to `Reconnect on Disconnect` with a retry interval you specify in seconds
