## Per Event Settings

In this section is where you can really customise TwitchSpeaker TTS with your own unique message and your flare and personality to it also it doesnâ€™t have to be just one single message. You can have multiple different messages for each event and TwitchSpeaker will choose one at random or you can add weight to each message (this makes it that TwitchSpeaker will favour 1 message more than the other that are available). In this section you also have a check box that allows you to Enable/Disable a specific message.
