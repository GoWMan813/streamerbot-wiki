## Overview

This sub-action will create a [Stream Marker](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/creating-highlights-and-stream-markers?language=en_US#markers) on Twitch. You can use this to signify an important event, or as a reminder for a point in the stream you'd like to review in your VOD at a later time. 

> **IMPORTANT**
> Stream Markers are only available if you have VODs enabled on your channel!
