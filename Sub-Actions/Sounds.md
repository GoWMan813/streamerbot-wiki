Streamer.bot has the capability of playing sounds directly from the application, no sources in your streaming software are required.

> Currently there is no way to pause or stop a sound once it has started other than forcing the application to close
{.is-warning}

You can choose a specific sound file to play or specify a folder and have the bot pick one at random
