## Overview

All [events](/en/Events) in Streamer.bot will generate an **argument stack** specific to that event source, providing variable data to the action (and subsequent [sub-actions](/en/Sub-Actions)) being called.

Most events will always include all generic arguments in addition to their own documented variables. Any exceptions will be listed on the page detailing that function.

**This list is not exhaustive and some variables may work with sub-actions / events even though they do not specifically state compatibility.**

> If an event is not documented, you can always use [Log All Arguments](/Sub-Actions/Code/Execute-CSharp-Code/Examples/Log-All-Arguments) in a sub-action to see all variables available to you.
{.is-info}


## Usage

Variables can be used in most [sub-action](/en/Sub-Actions) text inputs.

To use a variable from the current argument stack, wrap the variable name with a `%` symbol, e.g. `%userName%`

### Tips

- Arguments only persist until the called action finishes execution and can not be referenced by any other action
	- If you want to share variables across multiple actions you can write them out to a [Global](/en/Sub-Actions/Logic/Global-Variables) variable{.small}
- Variables are added onto the argument stack during execution of each sub-action
  - If you are testing and a variable seems to be missing, ensure you are testing at the right point of execution{.small}
- You do not need to wrap variable names with `%` within logic statements like `If` and `Global`
  - This was required in older versions of Streamer.bot{.small}
  - Wrapped variable names will still work as normal in this context{.small}


### Formatting
Variables can be formatted inline using standard C# notation

For example, to format a numeric veriable `%tipAmount%` as a currency with 2 decimal places, we can use the following syntax: `%tipAmount:c2%`

Similarly, `%time%` can be formatted in short notation with AM/PM using the following syntax: `%time:t%` 

Further information on valid formatting modifiers can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/standard-numeric-format-strings) and valid format strings for `%time%` can be found [here](/en/Sub-Actions/Code/Other/DateTime)

### Inline Functions

> Anywhere you can do a variable replacement, you can also execute [Inline Functions](/en/Inline-Functions)
