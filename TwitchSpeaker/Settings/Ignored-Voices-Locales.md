## Configuration
First you'll need to make a profile, you can do this in the top right corner. Type a name in the `Name` field (recommended to be descriptive) and click the `New` button. Now you can configure this profile by changes the ignored voices/locales. <kbd>Double-Click</kbd> on the voice/locale you want to ignore. And now it will ignore that voice/locale, to undo this just <kbd>Double-Click</kbd> on the ignored voice/locale and it will be available for random voice selection again. To switch between profiles the only thing you need to do is just switch between the profiles under `Profile` and you can even select `<none>` to don't ignore any voices/locales.
