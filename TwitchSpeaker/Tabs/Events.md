## Global Event Settings
First section of this tab you will see is a `Global Event Settings` here you will be able to see a `Voice Alias` that will complete all the events here unless specified otherwise. next to this is a check box that will enable the use of this voice or the generic one you have chosen for the TwitchSpeaker TTS to use for everything.

## Event States
In this section you have a check box to enable/disable the event triggers for TwitchSpeaker to announce along with additional options as seen in the screenshot below. You can specify the amount for Cheer, Donations, Raids and Hosts with (x) number of viewers.

## Per Event Settings
This section is where you can really customise TwitchSpeaker TTS with your own unique message and your flair and personality. also it doesnâ€™t have to be just one single message. You can have multiple different messages for each event and TwitchSpeaker will choose one at random or you can add weight to each message (this makes it that TwitchSpeaker will favour 1 message more than the other that are available). In this section you also have a checkbox that allows you to Enable/Disable a specific message.
