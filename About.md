**Streamer.bot**, supercharge your stream!

Prior to the public release, Streamer.bot, also known at one point as Channel Points Handler, was available within the VR comminuty for just over a year.  On August 20th, 2021, with the help of many amazing people, it was finally made available to everyone!

The support and seeing so many folks starting to use it, and learn it has been rather overwhelming, I never thought it would gain this much traction, and so far, there are no signs of it slowing down.
