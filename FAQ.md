<details class="faq">
<summary>Why is streamer.bot not opening?</summary>

There a couple of things that can cause this
1. Your `settings.json` file has been corrupted
   * If this has happend follow this guide below
   * [<i class="mdi mdi-backup-restore primary--text"></i> Backup & Restore Guide](/Backup)
2. You have moved/deleted/renamed files from your streamer.bot folder
   * If you have moved for example your `streamer.bot.exe` file to your desktop, streamer.bot won't start. To fix this move the file back and if you lost that file download it download the files [here](https://streamer.bot)
