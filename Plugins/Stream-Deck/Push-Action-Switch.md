## Configuration
### Action on Push
This is a dropdown with a list of all your actions, these actions will be listed in groups and in there they're sorted alphabetically. This action will run when pressing down the button.

### Action on Release
This is a dropdown with a list of all your actions, these actions will be listed in groups and in there they're sorted alphabetically. This action will run when releasing the button.

### Arguments
This is an JSON Object with all arguments you want to add in the action. By default this is `{}` and this will add no arguments.

Under this field you can see if your JSON is valid or invalid, this will be updated everytime you type in this field.

In the future there are plans on improving this to have the arguments in a more table like style.
