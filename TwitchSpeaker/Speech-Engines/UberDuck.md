1. Make an account on https://uberduck.ai.
2. Go to the Pricing page and get the `Creator` subscription at https://app.uberduck.ai/pricing.
3. Now once you've gotten the subscription go to the Manage Account page at  https://app.uberduck.ai/account/manage.
4. Go the `Manage API Keys` part and create a new key, simply give it a name and click the create button.
5. Now you will be given 2 keys, a public key and a secret key. Now put the public key in the `Client` field in TwitchSpeaker and the Secret key in the `Secret` field in TwitchSpeaker, and now you can connect by clicking `UberDuck` in the `Add Engine` list. 

Since UberDuck is an AI Text To Speech service that is community supported, not all voices are good quality.

There is a minimum quality setting, that defaults to 85, this will enable around 400 of the voices, the lower you set this, the more voices you will have access to.

> UberDuck is a paid service
