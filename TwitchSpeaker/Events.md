In the TwitchSpeaker Events Tab you will find a series of configurable event for the TTS 

So to get to this tab all you need to to do is to open TwitchSpeaker then click Events tab you will land on this page shown below.

First section of this tab you will see is a  `Global Event Settings` here you will be able to see a `Voice Alias` that will complete all the events here unless specified otherwise. next to this is a check box that will enable the use of this voice or the generic one you have chosen as a whole for the TwitchSpeaker TTS.
