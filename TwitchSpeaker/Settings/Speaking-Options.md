### Speaking Options 

In this section you will find most of the control in this tab. 

The `Say everything` option can be Enabled or disabled  so when this option is enable twitch speaker will say everything in chat  unless  the chatter/user is on the ingnored list. When this option is disbale the user/chatters are required to use the `TTS Speaking Commands` that you have set in that section (this will be explained later) but default it is either `! or !say` before the message for twitch speaker to speak this.
