## Connecting your Twitch account!
![connect_to_twitch_.png](/quick-start/connect_to_twitch_.png =800x)
1. Navigate through the following: `Platforms` `->` `Twitch` `->` `Accounts`
2. Press the `Connect to Twitch` button to bring up an authorization webpage that will detail all the permissions **Streamer.bot** wants to have access to on your behalf

It's recommended to tick all the `Auto (Re)connect` boxes in streamer.bot

> **WARNING**
> You can not type into either of the username boxes. They will display your username once you have authenticated.
{.is-warning}

## Broadcaster Account
This is your main account that streamer.bot uses for most the things from Twitch so for Events and most Sub-Actions a broadcaster account will be required.

## Bot Account
The bot account will be primarily used for sending messages/whispers, but it isn't required for most uses.

Soon in *v0.1.14*{.version-badge} it can also listen to a whipser event

> **WARNING**
> Sending whipsers programatically is something that `Twitch` restricts fairly heavily.
If the chosen account is not more than **12** months old, or already pre-verified as a **bot** you will not be able to send whispers from the application
{.is-warning}

Once you have a bot account configured, you can select which account should send chat messages on a per [sub-actions](/Sub-Actions) level.
