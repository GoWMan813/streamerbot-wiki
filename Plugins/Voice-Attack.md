## Overview
This plugin allows you to execute Streamer.bot actions with [Voice Attack](https://voiceattack.com/)

This is more of a proof of concept then a fully realized plugin, while it does work, it was thrown together very quickly, and I'm sure there are better ways to do what it does, and also to add more features/capabilities

**Make sure that the that the [WebSocket Server](/en/Servers-Clients/WebSocket-Server) is enabled in streamer.bot**

## Installation
1. Close down the `StreamDeck` application
1. Double click the `nate1280.streamerbot.streamDeckPlugin` file that you've downloaded above, this will automatically install the plugin
3. Make sure that the `Streamer.bot Authentication` field matches your [WebSocket Server](/en/Servers-Clients/WebSocket-Server) settings
