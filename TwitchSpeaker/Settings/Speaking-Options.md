### Speaking Options 

In this section you will find most of the control in this tab. 

The `Say everything` option can be Enabled or disabled  so when this option is enable twitch speaker will say everything in chat  unless  the chatter/user is on the ingnored list. When this option is disable the user/chatters are required to use the `TTS Speaking Commands` that you have set in that section (this will be explained later) but default it is either `! or !say` before the message for twitch speaker to speak this. 

The `Say Username` option again the same enable / disable options . When enabled is will speak the username of the message being spoken  and if this is disabled the username is skipped  however, this option does have a post fix which you can edit by changing the text in this field by default it is set to `said`  Example: "Omnidreamer said Hello". This is the example if this option is enabled but if this is disabled twitch speaker it would just say "Hello" 

The `Sticky Random Voice`. this make the first random voice chosen by twitchspeaker is assigned to the user when they have spoken.

The `Allowed Forced` option 

The ` Only say username if previous was different`
